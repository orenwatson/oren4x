Here is the code I wrote as my own special scaler for old video games.

As a bonus, here are some palettes for game boy games.
you can use them by doing for example
xxd -rp <gb.warm-on-cool >~/.mednafen/palettes/gb.pal
if you don't have xxd the program xtob that I included will work, like
xtob <gb.warm-on-cool >~/.mednafen/palettes/gb.pal
